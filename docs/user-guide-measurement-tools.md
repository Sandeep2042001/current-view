# Measurement Tools User Guide

## Overview

The Interactive 360¬∞ Platform includes powerful measurement tools that allow you to take precise measurements within your 360¬∞ spaces. These tools use 3D coordinates and provide accurate distance calculations with multiple unit options.

## Accessing Measurement Tools

### From the Web Viewer
1. Open any processed 360¬∞ room in the web viewer
2. Click the measurement tool icon (üìè) in the toolbar
3. The measurement tools panel will appear on the right side

### From the Mobile App
1. Navigate to a completed room
2. Tap the "View Room" button
3. Use the measurement icon in the viewer controls

## Types of Measurements

### 1. Point-to-Point Measurements
**Purpose**: Measure straight-line distance between two points

**How to Use**:
1. Select "Point to Point" tool
2. Click on the first point in the 360¬∞ view
3. Click on the second point
4. The measurement is automatically saved with the calculated distance

**Best For**:
- Room dimensions (length, width, height)
- Distance between objects
- Doorway measurements

### 2. Corner Measurements
**Purpose**: Measure angles and distances at corner points

**How to Use**:
1. Select "Corner" tool
2. Click on the first point (one side of the angle)
3. Click on the corner point (vertex of the angle)
4. Click on the third point (other side of the angle)
5. Both distance and angle are calculated and saved

**Best For**:
- Room corner angles
- Architectural features
- Furniture placement angles

### 3. Edge Measurements
**Purpose**: Measure complex distances along edges or multiple points

**How to Use**:
1. Select "Edge" tool
2. Click on the starting point
3. Continue clicking points along the edge
4. Right-click or use the "Finish" button when complete
5. Total length along all points is calculated

**Best For**:
- Curved walls or surfaces
- Perimeter measurements
- Complex architectural features

## Measurement Settings

### Units
Choose from:
- **Meters** (default)
- **Feet**
- **Inches**
- **Centimeters**
- **Millimeters**

### Precision
Set decimal places:
- **1 decimal** (e.g., 3.5m)
- **2 decimals** (e.g., 3.54m)
- **3 decimals** (e.g., 3.542m)

### Display Options
- **Show Labels**: Toggle measurement labels on/off
- **Auto-save**: Measurements are automatically saved

## Tips for Accurate Measurements

### Camera Positioning
- **Stable shots**: Use a tripod or steady hands
- **Eye level**: Keep camera at consistent height
- **Overlap**: Ensure 30-50% overlap between photos
- **Lighting**: Use consistent, good lighting

### Measurement Technique
- **Click precisely**: Click exactly on the points you want to measure
- **Use zoom**: Zoom in for more precise point selection
- **Multiple angles**: Take measurements from different viewpoints for verification
- **Reference objects**: Use known objects for scale verification

### Best Practices
- **Label measurements**: Add descriptive labels to identify what was measured
- **Group related measurements**: Measure related features together
- **Document context**: Note measurement purpose and conditions
- **Verify accuracy**: Cross-check critical measurements

## Managing Measurements

### Viewing Measurements
- All measurements appear in the measurements list
- Click any measurement to highlight it in the 3D view
- View measurement details including coordinates and metadata

### Editing Measurements
- Click the edit icon (‚úèÔ∏è) next to any measurement
- Update the label or description
- Measurements coordinates cannot be edited (create new measurement instead)

### Deleting Measurements
- Click the delete icon (üóëÔ∏è) next to any measurement
- Confirm deletion in the popup dialog
- Deleted measurements cannot be recovered

### Exporting Measurements
- Use the export feature to download measurement data
- Formats available: CSV, JSON, PDF report
- Include measurement images and metadata

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Measurement appears inaccurate**
- Check if the 360¬∞ images were properly calibrated
- Ensure sufficient overlap between source images
- Verify the room processing completed successfully

**Cannot click on desired point**
- Zoom in for better precision
- Ensure the viewer has finished loading
- Try clicking slightly to the side of the target point

**Measurements not saving**
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you have proper permissions for the project
- Try refreshing the page and attempting again

**Units not converting correctly**
- Verify the unit selection in settings
- Check if the base measurement scale is correct
- Contact support if persistent conversion issues occur

### Performance Tips
- **Limit active measurements**: Hide measurements not currently needed
- **Use appropriate precision**: Higher precision requires more processing
- **Batch operations**: Complete related measurements together
- **Regular saves**: Measurements auto-save, but verify important ones

## Advanced Features

### Measurement Statistics
- View statistics for all measurements in a room
- See average, minimum, and maximum distances
- Export statistical reports

### Measurement Validation
- Cross-reference with known dimensions
- Use multiple measurement types for verification
- Compare measurements across different viewing angles

### Integration with Annotations
- Link measurements to annotation points
- Create measurement-specific annotations
- Export combined measurement and annotation reports
